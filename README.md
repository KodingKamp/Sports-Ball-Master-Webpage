A little web page for downloading the Sports Ball Master Java application and viewable pdf of the User Manual.

Sports Ball Master is a Team Management System that allows users to create accounts, follow specific teams, request to join teams, and invite users to join teams.
This application also provides team statistics and a viewable calendar of past, present and future games.

This software was created as a group project for the Software Engineering Fundamentals course taken at Florida Gulf Coast University. 
In said project, I was the lead back-end programmer along-side Nicolas Caceda who was a back-end contributor, Luis Mendez who worked on front-end design, Brandon Shultz who build the front-end skeleton and assisted in the resulting design, and Trevor Evans who created helped develop the use cases for the software.
